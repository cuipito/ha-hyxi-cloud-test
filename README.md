### 🔧 Device Control

This integration supports writing control commands to compatible inverters via the HYXI Cloud API.

Controls are scoped per device type — each device only gets the controls it supports:

#### Hybrid Inverter / All-in-One

The HYXI API defines controls by **phase type** (Single Phase / Three-Phase). The integration auto-detects phase type and exposes matching controls:

| Phase | Controls | controlId |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Three-Phase** | Operating Mode buttons (Idle / Charge / Discharge / Self-Consumption) | 1062–1065 |
| **Three-Phase** | Charge / Discharge Power | — |
| **Three-Phase** | Battery Protection Numbers (`SOC Minimum`, `SOC Maximum`, min/max hysteresis) | — |
| **Three-Phase** | Last Sent Mode sensor | — |
| **Single Phase** | Peak Shaving buttons (Close / Charge / Discharge / Stop / Hold) | 1021 |
| **Single Phase** | Frequency Control (Enable / Disable) | 1020 |
| **Single Phase** | Battery Protection Numbers (`SOC Minimum`, `SOC Maximum`, min/max hysteresis) | — |
| **Single Phase** | Last Sent Mode sensor | — |

**Phase Detection** — determined in priority order:

1. **Model name suffix:** `-HT` / `-HTA` / `-ET` → Three-Phase, `-HS` / `-LS` → Single Phase
2. **Runtime metrics:** Phase power keys (`ph2Loadp` / `ph3Loadp` / `ph2p` / `ph3p`) or non-zero phase 2/3 voltage (`ph2v` / `ph3v`) → Three-Phase

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the phase type cannot be determined from either the model name or runtime metrics, **no control entities are created**. This is a safety measure to prevent sending unsupported commands to your inverter. If you believe your device should have controls, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Veldkornet/ha-hyxi-cloud/issues) with your device model and we will add support.

#### Battery Protection

For supported hybrid inverter and all-in-one devices, the integration exposes battery protection entities in Home Assistant for both **three-phase operating modes** and **single-phase peak shaving**.

Configurable `number` entities:

- `SOC Minimum`
- `SOC Maximum`
- `SOC Minimum Hysteresis`
- `SOC Maximum Hysteresis`

Read-only sensor:

- `Last Sent Mode`

Protection behavior depends on the control surface the device supports:

##### Three-Phase Operating Modes

- At or below `SOC Minimum`, manual `discharge` and `self_consume` commands are blocked.
- Manual `charge` remains allowed for recovery.
- Low-SOC protection stays active until SOC rises to `soc_min + soc_min_hysteresis_pct`.
- At or above `SOC Maximum`, manual `charge` is blocked.
- `self_consume` and `discharge` remain allowed on the high-SOC side.
- High-SOC protection stays active until SOC falls to `soc_max - soc_max_hysteresis_pct`.

##### Single-Phase Peak Shaving

- At or below `SOC Minimum`, peak-shaving `discharge` is blocked.
- Peak-shaving `charge` remains allowed for recovery.
- Low-SOC protection uses `hold` as the safe neutral state so PV can keep generating while the battery remains idle.
- At or above `SOC Maximum`, peak-shaving `charge` is blocked.
- Peak-shaving `discharge` and `hold` remain allowed on the high-SOC side.
- High-SOC protection stays active until SOC falls to `soc_max - soc_max_hysteresis_pct`.

The `Last Sent Mode` sensor records the last supported control action sent by Home Assistant, is restored across Home Assistant restarts, and re-sends that last action after restore so the device is returned to the same control state that Home Assistant expects.

#### Microinverter

| Controls | controlId |
| :--- | :--- |
| Power On/Off | 3011 |
| Power Limit (0–100%) | 3012 |
| Restart | 3013 |

#### Unsupported Device Types

> [!WARNING]
> **Micro ESS (EMS):** Control entities are **not** enabled for EMS devices. The HYXI API documentation does not list any control endpoints for EMS — the EMS API section only provides read-only data queries.

### 🛡️ Reliability & Diagnostics

This integration includes a specialized diagnostic system to help you distinguish between local hardware issues and cloud service outages.

| Sensor | Purpose | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud Status** | Binary connectivity sensor. | Indicates Cloud connectivity. Includes **Connection Quality** and **Data Freshness** as attributes. |
| **Device Alarm** | Hardware fault tracking. | Binary sensor that turns `On` if the hardware reports active alarms. |
| **Integration Last Updated** | Local Sync timestamp. | The exact time Home Assistant last successfully processed a cloud update. |

## ⚙️ Setup & Configuration

1. Ensure you have a developer account and have created an **application** to obtain an **Access Key** and **Secret Key** from the [HYXIPOWER Developer Platform](https://open.hyxicloud.com/#/quickStart).

   > **Important:**
   > Use the same email address that your devices are registered to in the HYXI app.
2. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services** > **Add Integration** > **HYXI Cloud**.
Or alternatively, add the integration with the following:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=hyxi_cloud)

## Configuration

1. Enter your **Access Key** and **Secret Key** from the HYXI Open API portal.

### Optional Features (Options Flow)
Click the **Configure** button on the HYXI integration card to access:
* **Polling Interval:** Adjust frequency between 1–60 minutes (Default: 5).
* **Enable Discovery via Alarms:** Proactively discover child devices reporting active alarms (Advanced).

## 🛡️ Quality Assurance

This integration prioritizes data integrity and system stability above all else:
- **99% Test Coverage**: Every line of core logic is validated against dozens of simulated hardware scenarios.
- **Glitch Filtering**: Built-in protection against impossible energy "spikes" and "dips" often caused by cloud reporting delays.
- **Continuous Integration**: Every change is automatically scanned for security vulnerabilities (CodeQL) and code quality (Ruff).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you are opening a bug report, please include **Debug Logs**:
**How to enable and download debug logs:**
1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services** > **HYXI Cloud**.
2. Click the three dots (⋮) and select **Enable debug logging**.
3. Wait 5-10 minutes, then click **Disable debug logging** to download the file.
4. Attach the downloaded log file to your GitHub issue — **no manual editing needed**, serial numbers, plant IDs, and your home address are automatically masked in the logs.
