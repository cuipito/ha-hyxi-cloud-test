### 🔧 Device Control

This integration supports writing control commands to compatible inverters via the HYXI Cloud API.

Controls are scoped per device type — each device only gets the controls it supports:

#### Hybrid Inverter / All-in-One

The HYXI API defines controls by **phase type** (Single Phase / Three-Phase). The integration auto-detects phase type and exposes matching controls:

| Phase | Controls | controlId |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Three-Phase** | Operating Mode buttons (Mode: Idle / Mode: Charge / Mode: Discharge / Mode: Self-Consumption) | 1062–1065 |
| **Three-Phase** | Target Charge / Discharge Power | — |
| **Single Phase** | Peak Shaving buttons (Peak Shaving: Turn Off / Peak Shaving: Force Charge / Peak Shaving: Force Discharge / Peak Shaving: Stop / Peak Shaving: Hold) | 1021 |
| **Single Phase** | Frequency Control (Enable / Disable) | 1020 |

**Phase Detection** — determined in priority order:

1. **Model name suffix:** `-HT` / `-HTA` / `-ET` → Three-Phase, `-HS` / `-LS` → Single Phase
2. **Runtime metrics:** Phase power keys (`ph2Loadp` / `ph3Loadp` / `ph2p` / `ph3p`) or non-zero phase 2/3 voltage (`ph2v` / `ph3v`) → Three-Phase

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the phase type cannot be determined from either the model name or runtime metrics, **no control entities are created**. This is a safety measure to prevent sending unsupported commands to your inverter. If you believe your device should have controls, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Veldkornet/ha-hyxi-cloud/issues) with your device model and we will add support.

#### Energy Manager Standalone (Beta)

The Energy Manager Standalone is an automated battery control engine that runs a 15-second decision loop inside Home Assistant. It reads your P1 smart meter, solar production, battery SOC, and optional solar forecast to automatically manage your inverter's operating mode (charge, discharge, self-consume, idle).

> [!NOTE]
> This is the **Standalone** energy manager — it makes all decisions locally based on real-time sensor data and configurable rules. A future **Day Ahead** energy manager (optimizing against dynamic energy prices) is planned for a separate release.

**Important:** The Energy Manager builds on top of the existing Battery Protection — it does **not** replace it. SOC minimum/maximum limits are read from the existing protection number entities and are always respected.

##### Prerequisites

- **Enable Device Control & Protection** must be turned on first (Options → Configure)
- A **P1 smart meter** entity (power sensor) configured in Home Assistant

##### Enabling

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services** > **HYXI Cloud** > **Configure**.
2. Enable **Device Control & Protection** and save.
3. Re-open **Configure** — the **Enable Energy Manager Standalone (Beta)** toggle is now visible.
4. Enable it and configure:
   - **P1 Smart Meter** — your grid power sensor (required, e.g. `sensor.p1_meter_power`)
   - **Solar Forecast Remaining Today** — remaining solar energy for today in kWh (optional)
   - **Solar Forecast Current Power** — current predicted solar power in W (optional)
   - **Inverter to Control** — which inverter the engine manages
   - **Override Battery Capacity** — check this to manually set battery capacity (see below)
   - **Battery Capacity (Wh)** — manual override value (only used when override is checked)

The Energy Manager is **disabled by default** even after enabling it in options. You must also turn on the **Energy Manager** switch entity. Each sub-feature (Night Mode, High Load Assist) must be individually enabled via its own switch entity.

##### Solar Forecast Integration

The engine can use solar forecast data to make smarter decisions about battery preservation and charge timing. Two optional forecast entities can be configured:

- **Solar Forecast Remaining Today (kWh):** Used for night preservation decisions — the engine checks whether remaining solar can recharge the battery to the night target before sunset. Compatible with:
  - [Forecast.Solar](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/forecast_solar/) — use the `energy_production_today_remaining` sensor
  - [Solcast](https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar) — use the `forecast_remaining_today` sensor
  - Any sensor providing remaining solar energy for today in kWh

- **Solar Forecast Current Power (W):** Currently reserved for future use. Compatible with:
  - [Forecast.Solar](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/forecast_solar/) — use the `power_production_now` sensor
  - [Solcast](https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar) — use the `forecast_this_hour` sensor

If no forecast entities are configured, the engine estimates solar availability from current production and time to sunset.

##### Battery Capacity

The engine needs to know your battery's total capacity (in Wh) for SOC calculations, night reserve estimation, and high-load cost analysis.

**How it's determined (in priority order):**

1. **Manual override** — If you check *Override Battery Capacity* in the energy manager options and set a value, that value is always used.
2. **API auto-detection** — The `batCap` metric from your inverter (reported in kWh, converted to Wh). Most hybrid inverters report this automatically.
3. **Fallback** — 2000 Wh if neither of the above is available.

> [!TIP]
> If your inverter reports `batCap` correctly (visible as the "Battery Capacity" sensor on your inverter device), you don't need to configure anything. The override is for situations where the API value is missing, incorrect, or you have modified your battery setup.

##### How It Works — Decision Priorities

Every 15 seconds the engine evaluates these priorities in order. The first matching priority wins:

| Priority | Condition | Action | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Emergency Low SOC** | SOC < SOC Minimum | Charge from solar or grid | If solar is producing, charges from solar. If no solar and *Grid Charge Allowed* is on, charges from grid at up to 2000W. Otherwise goes idle to prevent further drain. |
| **2. Over-Max SOC** | SOC > SOC Maximum | Forced discharge | Discharges at the higher of current grid import or 1000W, capped at max discharge power. Prevents overcharging. |
| **2b. Export Limiting** | Grid export > max limit | Charge or curtail PV | Single-phase only. Uses peak shaving control. See details below. |
| **3. High Load Assist** | Home load > threshold | Battery assist or grid-only | Only active when the *High Load Battery Assist* switch is ON. See details below. |
| **4. Night Mode** | Nighttime (sun below horizon) | Self-consume or idle | Only active when the *Night Mode* switch is ON. See details below. |
| **5. Solar Optimization** | Solar producing + SOC < max | Smart charge from solar | Waits for sustained grid export before entering charge mode. Continuously tunes charge power to minimize grid import/export. |
| **Default** | None of the above | Self-consume | Safe fallback. If currently charging or discharging, switches to self-consume. |

##### Night Mode (Priority 4)

**Requires:** *Night Mode* switch entity → ON (default: OFF)

Night Mode manages battery usage during nighttime and preserves battery for overnight consumption:

- **At night (sun below horizon, no solar):**
  - If SOC is above SOC Minimum → **self-consume** (battery powers the house)
  - If SOC is at or below SOC Minimum → **idle** (stop discharging, protect the reserve)

- **During daytime — night preservation:**
  - If SOC has dropped to or below the calculated *night SOC target* and the house is importing from grid and solar forecast cannot cover the gap → **idle** (preserve remaining battery for tonight)

The **night SOC target** is automatically calculated based on:
- `Average Night Consumption` (W) — configurable, also auto-updated hourly from real P1 data between 21:00–06:00
- `Night Buffer %` — extra safety margin (default 5%)
- Battery capacity (from options or API)
- Hours until sunrise

Formula: `night_target = soc_min + ((avg_consumption × hours_remaining × (1 + buffer%)) / capacity) × 100`

**Example:** With 400W average consumption, 14.8 kWh battery, 5% buffer, 20% SOC minimum, 12 hours until sunrise:
Night target ≈ 20% + 34% = **54%**. The engine will preserve battery above 54% during daytime if it calculates that solar won't be enough to recharge before sunset.

##### High Load Assist (Priority 3)

**Requires:** *High Load Battery Assist* switch entity → ON (default: OFF)

High Load Assist detects when your home consumption exceeds a configurable threshold and decides whether the battery should help:

- **Home load > High Load Threshold** and assist is enabled:
  - Calculates the SOC cost of running battery assist for 30 minutes at 50% max discharge power
  - If the battery can afford it (remaining SOC after assist would still exceed the night SOC target) → **self-consume** (battery helps power the high load)
  - If the battery cannot afford it (would drain below night target) → **idle** (let the grid handle it, preserve battery for night)

- **Home load below threshold:** No action, falls through to next priority.

**Use case:** Running an oven, EV charger, or heat pump. The engine prevents the battery from draining itself to cover a temporary spike that would leave you with insufficient reserve for the night.

##### Export Limiting (Priority 2b)

**Requires:** *Export Limiting* switch entity → ON (default: OFF)

**Single-phase devices only** — uses peak shaving control (controlId 1021) which is not available on three-phase inverters.

Export Limiting caps how much power is fed back to the grid:

- **Grid export > Max Grid Export** and battery has room (SOC < SOC Maximum):
  - Charges battery to absorb excess (minimum 300W, capped at max charge power)
  - Continuously adjusts charge power as export fluctuates

- **Grid export > Max Grid Export** and battery is full:
  - Sends peak shaving `stop` to curtail PV production entirely
  - 30-second cooldown between stop/hold toggles prevents oscillation

- **Grid export drops below limit:**
  - Sends peak shaving `hold` to resume PV production
  - Returns to self-consume

**Use case:** Feed-in tariff limits, grid connection limits, or reducing grid export to maximize self-consumption.

##### Solar Charge Logic (Priority 5)

When solar is producing and the battery isn't full, the engine optimizes charging:

1. **Entry gate:** Solar must exceed `Min Solar for Charge` (default: 1000W).
2. **Export confirmation:** Grid export must exceed `Charge Entry Threshold` (default: 500W) for several consecutive readings before entering charge mode. This prevents charge/discharge oscillation on cloudy days.
3. **Power tuning:** Once charging, the engine continuously adjusts charge power to keep P1 close to zero (not importing, not exporting).
4. **Bottomout exit:** If charge power drops to minimum (100W) for 3 consecutive ticks due to insufficient solar, exits back to self-consume.
5. **Sunset urgency:** Within 4 hours of sunset, if SOC is below the night target and solar forecast won't cover it, entry thresholds are relaxed to capture remaining solar.

##### Grid Charge Allowed

The *Grid Charge Allowed* switch (on the inverter device, not the Energy Manager device) controls whether the engine may charge the battery from the grid during emergencies. This is only used when SOC drops below minimum and there is no solar available. Default: OFF.

##### Entity Reference

| `previous_mode` | Mode before the change |
| `decision` | Decision label that triggered the change |
| `dry_run` | `true` if in dry-run mode (field absent when not dry-run) |

#### Real-Time Push (Beta)

Real-Time Push replaces the default 5-minute polling with webhook-based push notifications from the HYXI Cloud. Device telemetry is pushed directly to your Home Assistant instance at configurable intervals (5 seconds to 1 hour), giving you near-real-time sensor updates.

**Requirements:**
- A publicly accessible URL for your Home Assistant instance (see setup options below)
- HYXI Cloud API library v1.2.6+

##### Enabling

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services** > **HYXI Cloud** > **Configure**.
2. Enable **Real-Time Push (Beta)** and save.
3. Configure the push settings:
   - **URL Mode** — `Manual URL` or `Nabu Casa` (see setup guides below)
   - **External URL** — your public HA URL (only for Manual mode)
   - **Push Interval (ms)** — how often HYXI Cloud pushes data (default: 30000ms = 30s, range: 5s–1h)

##### Setup Option A: Nabu Casa (Easiest)

If you have a [Nabu Casa](https://www.nabucasa.com/) subscription, this is the simplest setup — no port forwarding or reverse proxy needed.

1. Ensure **Home Assistant Cloud** is connected: **Settings > Home Assistant Cloud** → status should show "Connected".
2. Enable **Remote Control** in the Cloud settings (this provides your `*.ui.nabu.casa` URL).
3. In the HYXI Real-Time Push options, select **URL Mode: Nabu Casa**.
4. Leave the External URL field empty — the integration automatically uses your Nabu Casa remote URL.
5. Save. The integration will register a webhook and subscribe to push data.

> [!NOTE]
> The Nabu Casa remote URL must be active and reachable. If your cloud connection drops, push data will not arrive, but the 30-minute fallback poll will continue.

##### Setup Option B: Manual URL (Reverse Proxy / Cloudflare Tunnel)

Use this if you expose Home Assistant via a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, Traefik) or a Cloudflare Tunnel.

**Prerequisites:**
- A domain pointing to your HA instance (e.g. `https://ha.example.com`)
- HTTPS with a valid certificate (HYXI Cloud requires HTTPS for webhook callbacks)
- The `/api/webhook/` path must be publicly reachable without authentication

**Cloudflare Tunnel example:**

1. In your Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard, create a tunnel pointing to your HA instance (e.g. `http://homeassistant.local:8123`).
2. Map a public hostname (e.g. `ha.example.com`) to the tunnel.
3. **Important:** Do not add any Cloudflare Access policies to the `/api/webhook/*` path — webhook requests from HYXI Cloud must pass through without browser-based authentication.
4. In the HYXI Real-Time Push options:
   - Select **URL Mode: Manual URL**
   - Enter `https://ha.example.com` as the **External URL**
5. Save. The integration constructs the full callback URL as `https://ha.example.com/api/webhook/{generated-id}`.

**Nginx reverse proxy example:**

Ensure your Nginx config forwards webhook requests to HA:

```nginx
location /api/webhook/ {
    proxy_pass http://homeassistant.local:8123;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

Then configure the integration with your public domain as the External URL.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Security:** The webhook handler verifies the `accessKey` header on every incoming request against your configured HYXI API credentials. Unauthenticated requests are rejected with HTTP 401. You do not need to add additional authentication layers for the webhook path.

##### How It Works

- HYXI Cloud sends device telemetry to a registered webhook on your HA instance
- Each push updates all device sensors immediately (no waiting for next poll)
- Polling continues at a 30-minute fallback interval as a safety net
- If no push data is received for 120 seconds, the integration logs a staleness warning
- The webhook verifies the `accessKey` header on each request for security
- On integration unload, the push subscription is automatically cancelled

##### Troubleshooting Real-Time Push

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Sensors not updating in real-time | Webhook not reachable | Check that your URL is publicly accessible. Test with `curl -X POST https://your-url/api/webhook/test` — should return a response, not a timeout. |
| "Nabu Casa URL not available" error | Cloud not connected | Check **Settings > Home Assistant Cloud** → ensure status is "Connected" and Remote Control is enabled. |
| HTTP 401 in HA logs | Access key mismatch | The `accessKey` header from HYXI Cloud doesn't match your configured credentials. Re-enter your API keys in the integration. |
| Push stops after a while | Subscription expired | The integration re-subscribes on every reload. Try reloading the integration: **Settings > Devices & Services > HYXI Cloud > ⋮ > Reload**. |
| Data arrives but sensors show stale values | Field mapping issue | Check HA logs for warnings from `custom_components.hyxi_cloud.webhook`. Report unknown field names as a GitHub issue. |

##### Data Flow

```
HYXI Cloud → POST /api/webhook/{id} → HA webhook handler
  → Verify accessKey header
  → Translate fields (batterySoc → batsoc)
  → Compute derived metrics (grid import/export, bat charging/discharging)
  → Update coordinator → All sensors refresh instantly
```

#### Microinverter

| Controls | controlId |
| :--- | :--- |
| Power On/Off | 3011 |
| Power Limit (0–100%) | 3012 |
| Restart | 3013 |

#### Unsupported Device Types

> [!WARNING]
> **Micro ESS (EMS):** Control entities are **not** enabled for EMS devices. The HYXI API documentation does not list any control endpoints for EMS — the EMS API section only provides read-only data queries.
